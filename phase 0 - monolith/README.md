# Starting point

This is the monolith itself, which is simply:

- A standard vanilla Jboss Wildfly installation
- Two quickstarts: numberGuess and helloworld-html5 from https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart deployed in it

You can start it by:

- untaring the file,
- setting the wildfly_home env variable
- using /bin/standalone.sh
